The S\+DK provides .N\+ET 3.\+x and .N\+ET 4.\+x compatible packages in the {\ttfamily dotnet3} and {\ttfamily dotnet4} directories of the S\+DK\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Unity 5.\+x and earlier use the .N\+ET 3.\+x framework, so you need to import packages from the {\ttfamily dotnet3} directory.
\item Unity 2017.\+x and newer allow the use of the .N\+ET 4.\+x framework. If your project is configured to use .N\+ET 4.\+x, import packages from the {\ttfamily dotnet4} directory.

($\ast$ See Known Issues in the Release Notes below.)

This is a Beta feature, and is intended for workflow use only during the development of your app, not for publicly shipping code.\hypertarget{md_Assets_Firebase_Editor_readme_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Stub Implementations}\label{md_Assets_Firebase_Editor_readme_autotoc_md1}
Stub (non-\/functional) implementations of the remaining libraries are provided for convenience when building for Windows, OS X, and Linux, so that you don\textquotesingle{}t need to conditionally compile code when also targeting the desktop.\hypertarget{md_Assets_Firebase_Editor_readme_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Ad\+Mob}\label{md_Assets_Firebase_Editor_readme_autotoc_md2}
The Ad\+Mob Unity plugin is distributed separately and is available from the \href{https://firebase.google.com/docs/admob/unity/start}{\texttt{ Ad\+Mob Get Started}} guide.\hypertarget{md_Assets_Firebase_Editor_readme_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Known Issues}\label{md_Assets_Firebase_Editor_readme_autotoc_md3}
\hypertarget{md_Assets_Firebase_Editor_readme_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{.\+N\+E\+T 4.\+x compatibility when using Unity 2017.\+x and newer.}\label{md_Assets_Firebase_Editor_readme_autotoc_md4}
.N\+ET 4.\+x support is available as a build option in Unity 2017 and newer. Firebase plugins use components of the \href{https://github.com/parse-community/Parse-SDK-dotNET}{\texttt{ Parse S\+DK}} to provide some .N\+ET 4.\+x classes in earlier versions of .N\+ET. Therefore, versions {\ttfamily 5.\+4.\+0} and newer of the \{\{unity\+\_\+sdk\}\} provide plugins that are compatible with either .N\+ET 3.\+x or .N\+ET 4.\+x in {\ttfamily dotnet3} and {\ttfamily dotnet4} directories of the \{\{unity\+\_\+sdk\+\_\+link\}\}.

If you import a Firebase plugin that is incompatible with the .N\+ET version enabled in your project, you\textquotesingle{}ll see compile errors from some types in the .N\+ET framework that are implemented by the Parse S\+DK.

To resolve the compilation error, if you\textquotesingle{}re using .N\+ET 3.\+x\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Remove or disable the following D\+L\+Ls for all platforms\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Parse/\+Plugins/dot\+Net45/\+Unity.\+Compat.\+dll}
\item {\ttfamily Parse/\+Plugins/dot\+Net45/\+Unity.\+Tasks.\+dll}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Enable the following D\+L\+Ls for all platforms\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Parse/\+Plugins/\+Unity.\+Compat.\+dll}
\item {\ttfamily Parse/\+Plugins/\+Unity.\+Tasks.\+dll}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

To resolve the compilation error, if you\textquotesingle{}re using .N\+ET 4.\+x\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Remove or disable the following D\+L\+Ls for all platforms\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Parse/\+Plugins/\+Unity.\+Compat.\+dll}
\item {\ttfamily Parse/\+Plugins/\+Unity.\+Tasks.\+dll}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\item {\ttfamily Parse/\+Plugins/dot\+Net45/\+Unity.\+Tasks.\+dll}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

If you import another Firebase plugin\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Select the menu item {\ttfamily Assets $>$ Play Services Resolver $>$ Version Handler $>$ Update} to enable the correct D\+L\+Ls for your project.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_Assets_Firebase_Editor_readme_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{Unity 2017.\+2 Networking}\label{md_Assets_Firebase_Editor_readme_autotoc_md5}
Realtime Database creates T\+LS network connections using the .N\+ET networking stack. T\+LS functionality is broken in Unity 2017.\+2 when using .N\+ET 4.\+6 causing the Realtime Database plugin to fail in editor and on desktop. There is no workaround for this issue, you have to use a different version of Unity, for example 2017.\+1 or 2017.\+3.\hypertarget{md_Assets_Firebase_Editor_readme_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{Unity 4 workarounds}\label{md_Assets_Firebase_Editor_readme_autotoc_md6}
Firebase plugins are not officially supported in Unity 4. However, we do make an effort to ensure the plugins can work with some manual setup.

A couple of components do not work in Unity 4\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver\#unity-plugin-version-management}{\texttt{ Version Handler}} does not work due to no Plugin\+Importer and no clean way to prevent managed D\+L\+Ls from being loaded by Unity 4.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This means it\textquotesingle{}s not possible for plugins to automatically enable the most recent version of shared components (e.\+g Firebase, Ad\+Mob, Facebook etc. may share a common component).
\item D\+L\+Ls that target a specific .N\+ET version (e.\+g .N\+ET 4.\+x) are not disabled.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Managed (C\#) D\+L\+Ls cannot be targeted to a specific platform which breaks our plugin where we have platform specific C\# D\+L\+Ls for some components.
\end{DoxyItemize}

To use in Unity 4 you will need to\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Resolve any dependencies that are shared between multiple plugins. For example, Firebase and Ad\+Mob use the \href{https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver}{\texttt{ Play Services Resolver}} which contains D\+L\+Ls that encode the version in their filename under the folder {\ttfamily Play\+Services\+Resolver/\+Editor}. For each versioned D\+LL under the folder {\ttfamily Play\+Services\+Resolver/\+Editor} delete the oldest version of each D\+LL.
\item Remove .N\+ET 4.\+x D\+L\+Ls from {\ttfamily Parse/\+Plugins/dot\+Net45}.
\item Remove / rename platform specific D\+L\+Ls. Firebase plugins contain i\+OS specific D\+L\+Ls under the folder {\ttfamily Firebase/\+Plugins/i\+OS}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item When {\itshape not} building for i\+OS\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Change the extension of files under the {\ttfamily Firebase/\+Plugins/i\+OS} folder from {\ttfamily .dll} to {\ttfamily .dlldisabled}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item When building for i\+OS\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Change the extension of files under the {\ttfamily Firebase/\+Plugins/i\+OS} folder from {\ttfamily .dlldisabled} to {\ttfamily .dll}
\item For each file in {\ttfamily Firebase/\+Plugins/i\+OS} change the file extension of the same name under {\ttfamily Firebase/\+Plugins} from {\ttfamily .dll} to {\ttfamily .dlldisabled}. For example, {\ttfamily Firebase/\+Plugins/i\+O\+S/\+Firebase.\+App.\+dll} and {\ttfamily Firebase/\+Plugins/\+Firebase.\+App.\+dlldisabled}.

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Common\+: Updated Parse .N\+ET 4.\+6 forwarding D\+L\+Ls to fix build issues when using I\+L2\+C\+PP with the .N\+ET 4.\+6 framework. The update works with I\+L2\+C\+PP in Unity 2017.\+2 and beyond. I\+L2\+C\+PP builds still fail in Unity 2017.\+1 as the I\+L2\+C\+PP distribution bundled with Unity 2017.\+1 does not correctly support type forwarding D\+L\+Ls.
\item Common\+: Root cert installation is now {\itshape only} performed in plugins that use the .N\+ET network stack (currently only the Realtime Database). This should resolve exceptions on initialization that reference {\ttfamily /\+System/\+Library/\+Frameworks/\+Core\+Foundation.framework/\+Core\+Foundation}.
\item Common (Desktop)\+: Fixed crash when using Firebase Auth, Storage, Realtime Database and Remote Config on Linux.
\item Common (Android)\+: Loading default App\+Options is now more robust on Android resulting in errors reported for missing fields rather than exiting the application with an error in the native library.
